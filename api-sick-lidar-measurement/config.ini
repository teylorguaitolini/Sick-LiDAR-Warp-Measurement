# If you want to save the point cloud in a CSV file, set as True. Otherwise, set as False.
save_point_cloud = True
# angular range from 55 to 125 in LMS4000, in degrees. This comes from the sensor datasheet.
# As the angular range increases, the amount of noise in the point cloud also increases.
# The algorithm will filter the point cloud to eliminate the noise, but to have accurate
# measurement, it is recommended to fit the angular range the most possible in the object.
start_angle = 89
stop_angle = 100
# Encoder parameter: The number of pulses per revolution that the encoder
# generates. This values comes from the encoder datasheet.
pulses_per_rev = 1500
# Covered distance per revolution, to convert pulses in real distance.
# This value comes from measuring the real horizontal distance that the
# LiDAR covers in one revolution, in the setup/base we created to move the LiDAR.
mm_per_rev = 12
# Distance between the sensor and the object, in meters.
# this value helps to eliminate the noise in the point cloud.
# if you don't want to use, set as zero.
distance = 0
# Its the number of iterations that the filter will be applied to the Y axis
# of the point cloud. If you don't want to use, set as zero and the algorithm
# will automatically calculate the number of iterations.
